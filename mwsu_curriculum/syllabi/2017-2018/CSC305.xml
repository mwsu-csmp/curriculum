  <catalogDescription>
This course will introduce students to database design, data modeling and database implementation.  This will include fundamentals, developmental processes, data structures, and logical design, with an emphasis on the relational database model. They will also learn fundamental Structured Query Language (SQL).  Students will then apply these concepts using various modeling techniques and tools.  The course will cumulate with the student applying the skills they have learned to design, build and use a database within a professional Database Management System environment.  </catalogDescription>
