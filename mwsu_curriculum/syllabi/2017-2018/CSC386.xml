  <objectives>
    <objective>Understand the role of an operating system as an intermediary between a user program (or, a user) and the computer hardware. Explain how different operating system components facilitate the role.</objective>
    <objective>Compare different operating system design alternatives.</objective>
    <objective>Understand how an operating system provides to user programs an illusion of exclusive access to the hardware, while facilitating collaborations between them.</objective>
    <objective>Understand and compare scheduling algorithms designed for various operating system components.</objective>
    <objective>Examine some popular scheduling algorithms for problems that they address and their tradeoffs in terms of various factors including time/space complexity and possibilities of starvation.</objective>
