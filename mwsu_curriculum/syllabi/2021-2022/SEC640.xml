  <catalogDescription>
This is a hands-on network security course building on top of the networking and general security knowledge that students have already learned in previous courses. In this course, students will learn about different attacks against network protocols and applications. They will also learn about how attackers exploit the vulnerabilities of conventional network technologies to launch those attacks. They will also learn about the countermeasures that are designed to thwart the attacks and, more importantly, how each countermeasures work.
