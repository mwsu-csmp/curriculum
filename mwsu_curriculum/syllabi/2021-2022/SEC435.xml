  <title>Network and Endpoint Security</title>
  <offered>spring</offered>
  <scheduleType>lecture</scheduleType>
  <catalogDescription>This course covers the knowledge in securing networks and network endpoints, which are hardware devices that are connected to and communication across local area networks (LANs) and wide-area networks (WANs). Vulnerabilities of common networks and endpoints will be discussed together with the threats that exploit those vulnerabilities. Students will learn about the mechanisms of attacks that target various hardware and software components and how their countermeasures thwart the attacks. Students will learn the underlying security theories and will gain hands on experience through lab exercises.</catalogDescription>
