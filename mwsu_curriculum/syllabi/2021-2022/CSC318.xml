  <catalogDescription>
An introduction to computerized simulations. Focus is on the architecture and development of time-step and event-sequenced models used extensively by industry and government. Other topics include process generators for random events, the development of computerized games for management training, and current simulation research.

    <objective>Identify  the  appropriate  time  step  for  their  simulation  architecture  to  model  the  process being simulated. </objective>
    <objective>Identify the random process generators needed to appropriately model the process being simulated.</objective>
    <objective>Understand the relationship between the time step and the random processes</objective>
    <objective>Understand  the  probability  and  statistical  methods  necessary  to  create  finite  random process generators.</objective>
    <objective>Develop and program the random processes generators supporting the random activities in a simulation.  First Introduction is to generators with finite outcomes.</objective>

    <objective>Identify key events in a process so that the process can be adequately modeled/simulated with an event based architecture.</objective>
    <objective>Identify  and  create  processes  for  each  event  that  represents  the  eventâ€™s  impact  on  the simulation space.</objective>
    <objective>Understand the structure of classic game types (.i.e.single shooter first person, multiplayer, etc</objective>
    <objective>Design  and  develop  a  two  player  game  using  simple  AI  techniques  to  simulate  the movements by each player. </objective>
