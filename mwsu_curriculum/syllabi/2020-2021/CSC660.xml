This course offers graduate students in the Information Technology Assurance Administration program an opportunity to integrate theory with practice. Students work full-time or part-time for a company in a position related to their graduate research. Anticipated learning objectives are established in a contract agreed to by the student, the company supervisor, and the departmental faculty sponsor. May be repeated for credit, but at most 3 hours may count towards the total number of hours required for the master's program. International students should enroll in this course when completing their CPT training.
